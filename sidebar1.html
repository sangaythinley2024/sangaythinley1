          Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you
          click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video you
          want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for the
          video that best fits your document. To make your document look
          professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and
          text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add
          a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then
          choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and
          styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design
          and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics
          change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings
          change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that
          show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your
          document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it.
          When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a
          column, and then click the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, in the
          new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus on
          the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the
          end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device. Video
